\section{Discussion}
We built a visual interface for a recommender system powered by \gls{rfs}, a flexible recommendation model. Empirically, we demonstrated that \gls{rfs} outperforms \acrshort{bert} in an offline evaluation, while being orders of magnitude faster during training and recommendation. By deploying \gls{rfs} to AWS Lambda and hosting the visual interface on Github Pages, we demonstrated a fully open-source pipeline for creating an explanation-aware, controllable visual interface for document recommendation for editorial decision-making. Future work includes studying whether the transparency and control provided by open-source recommendation systems can improve user experience and educate users in how their information is exploited remains an open problem.
