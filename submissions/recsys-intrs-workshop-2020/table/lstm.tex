\caption{\textbf{The permutation-marginalized LSTM model performs poorly on the
    arXiv dataset of researcher reading behavior in terms of in-matrix recall.}
  We report the held-out recall averaged over 100~users due to the computational
  constraints of the model. It is much lower than that of other methods, but
  better than random.}
