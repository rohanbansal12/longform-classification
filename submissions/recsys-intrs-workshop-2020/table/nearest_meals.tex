\caption{\acrlong{rfs}, trained on food consumption data, provides diverse
  recommendations. We fit the model to data from a food tracking app as
  described in \Cref{sec:experiments_meals}; items are meals and attributes are
  the ingredients in the meal. We represent meals as the mean of their attribute
  embeddings, and use cosine similarity to compute the nearest neighbors of
  meals. This reveals that \acrlong{rfs} uncovers latent patterns of consumption
  in the attribute embeddings that can be leveraged to improve recommendations.
  For example, the second-last query meal is a mix of meat, vegetables, and
  fruit, and the nearest neighbor meal is a different meat and a side of salad.
  The last query meal is a sandwich, and its nearest neighbor is also a
  sandwich, but with different ingredients.}
